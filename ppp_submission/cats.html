					The felis silvestris catus, commonly known as a cat, is a very interesting species. It is believed
					they
					began being domesticated around 7500 B.C. in the western Asia region, and currently they are
					considered the
					second-most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat
					breeds,
					their care and diet can be very different. However, there are some diets and practices that are
					generally
					recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member.

				If the queen (yes, it is a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) is
				able to
				nurse the kitten directly, that is preferred. The kittens' growth should be monitored closely to make
				sure their
				growth rate is progressing steadily. If the kitten(s) are not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker
				might
				need to feed the kitten(s) directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens
				might not
				gain weight appropriately include:

				Typically, around 3–4 weeks after birth, the kitten can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food.
				According to <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at
				this age
				should eat 0.5–1 cup dry kitten food, or 6–9 ounces of wet kitten food, per day. Experts recommend that
				if the
				kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to help. Cat food that is
				optimized for kittens is always preferred, as it provides the additional nutrients that are needed for
				growth,
				energy, and wellness. Depending on the cat breed, your kitten may have different dietary requirements.
				You
				should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

				<h2><a id="1yr_7yrs">1 Year - 7 Years</a></h2>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At this age, when kittens are no longer kittens and have reached the <em>cat</em> stage, they do not
				need as
				much nutrients. At this point, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is
				recommended that you <strong>NOT</strong> leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a
				couple
				times a day so they eat meals rather than snack throughout the day. This practice is intended to reduce
				the risk
				of the cats suffering from obesity and other weight-related ailments.

			<p>
				Much like many living organisms, the cat body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes.
				Cats in
				this age should be fed fewer fats and calories, but more quality proteins. This mean when you are
				purchasing
				packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and NOT
				just a
				category (such as fish). The latter usually means the ingredients are byproducts, or combinations, of
				lesser
				quality proteins.
